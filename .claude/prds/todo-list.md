## Executive Summary

A minimalist personal todo list application designed for individual task management. Built as a lightweight MVP using vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, focusing on simplicity, beauty, and core CRUD functionality. The application aims to provide an elegant user experience for personal productivity without complex features or external dependencies.

## Problem Statement

- No backend server or database
- Client-side storage only (localStorage)

**Design Constraints:**
- Must work on mobile and desktop
- Must be keyboard accessible
- Must maintain simplicity - no complex features

**Timeline Constraints:**
- MVP delivery target: 2-3 development days
- Single developer implementation
- No complex architecture needed

**Resource Constraints:**
- No budget for hosting, databases, or external services
- No design system or UI framework
- Self-contained, standalone application

## Out of Scope

**Features explicitly NOT included in MVP:**
- User accounts or authentication
- Data synchronization across devices
- Advanced task features (due dates, priorities, categories)
- Collaboration or sharing features
- Export/import functionality
- Offline-first architecture
- Database integration
- Mobile app versions
- Integration with external services
- Advanced search or filtering
- Task history or analytics
- Bulk operations
- Drag-and-drop reordering

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- None (standalone application)

**Internal Dependencies:**
- Modern web browser with localStorage support
- Basic web server for serving static files (development)

**Development Dependencies:**
- Text editor/IDE
- Web browser for testing
- Optional: Live server for development

**Assumptions:**
- Users have modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- Users are comfortable with basic web interface interactions
- Data persistence needs are minimal (localStorage sufficient)
- Single user per browser/device is acceptable

## Implementation Notes
