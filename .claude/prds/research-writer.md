# PRD: Research Writer

## Executive Summary

Research Writer is a **简洁美观的个人便携式学术写作系统** (concise and elegant personal portable academic writing system) designed to leverage Claude's full capabilities to produce publication-standard academic papers. This HTML+JS+CSS MVP system provides a structured four-stage workflow that guides researchers from initial research through final quality assessment, with local storage and no backend requirements.

**Value Proposition**: Transform the academic writing process from chaotic to systematic, enabling researchers to produce higher-quality papers more efficiently through AI-assisted workflows and structured methodology.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

Academic writing is currently fragmented across multiple tools and processes:
- **Research chaos**: Literature scattered across databases, notes, and documents
- **Structure confusion**: No clear framework for organizing complex arguments
- **Quality uncertainty**: Difficult to assess if work meets publication standards
- **Tool fragmentation**: Switching between research tools, writing software, citation managers, and quality checkers

### Why is this important now?

1. **AI opportunity**: Claude's capabilities can dramatically enhance each stage of academic writing
2. **Accessibility need**: Many researchers lack access to expensive academic software suites
3. **Portability requirement**: Need for a system that works offline and across devices
4. **Quality standards**: Increasing competition requires systematic approaches to achieve publication quality
