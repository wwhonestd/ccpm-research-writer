# Task: Performance Optimization and Testing

## Description
Optimize the application for performance, conduct comprehensive testing across browsers and devices, and ensure the application meets all performance benchmarks specified in the PRD. This includes code optimization, performance measurement, and cross-browser compatibility testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Page load time <500ms (Lighthouse measurement)
- [ ] Todo operations respond within <100ms
- [ ] Bundle size <50KB total (HTML+CSS+JS)
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score >90
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile device testing on real devices
- [ ] Code optimization (minification, dead code removal)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and documentation
- [ ] Error handling testing (edge cases, localStorage limits)

## Technical Details
**Performance Optimization:**
- Minimize CSS and JavaScript
- Optimize DOM manipulation patterns
- Reduce layout thrashing and reflows
- Implement efficient event handling
- Optimize localStorage operations

**Testing Strategy:**
- Manual testing on target browsers
- Performance testing with Lighthouse
- Mobile testing on various devices
- Edge case testing (empty states, large lists, errors)
- User experience testing (task creation <3s, completion <2s)

**Code Quality:**
- Code review and refactoring
- Remove unused code and optimize functions
- Ensure no functions exceed 20 lines
- Validate naming conventions consistency
- Check for memory leaks in long-running sessions

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Modern browsers: Chrome 90+, Firefox 85+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- Mobile browsers: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet
- Test JavaScript ES6+ feature support
- Validate CSS Grid/Flexbox support

**Performance Measurements:**
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Total Blocking Time (TBT)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: Core CRUD operations completed
- [ ] Task 004: UI design can be tested in parallel

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-4 hours
- Parallel: true (can optimize while UI is being polished)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All performance benchmarks met and documented
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified on real devices
- [ ] Code optimized and refactored for performance
- [ ] No JavaScript console errors across browsers
- [ ] Application ready for production deployment
