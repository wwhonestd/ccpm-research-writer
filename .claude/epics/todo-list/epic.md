# Epic: todo-list

## Overview

A minimalist personal todo list application built with vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The implementation focuses on simplicity and performance, targeting a 2-3 day MVP delivery. The application will use localStorage for persistence and provide a clean, responsive interface for basic CRUD operations on todo items.

## Architecture Decisions

- **No Framework Approach**: Vanilla JavaScript to minimize complexity and maximize performance
- **Client-Side Only**: No backend required, reduces deployment complexity
- **localStorage Persistence**: Simple, reliable data storage for single-user scenarios  
- **Mobile-First Design**: CSS Grid/Flexbox with responsive breakpoints
- **Component-Based JS**: Modular functions for maintainability despite no framework
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works, then enhance with animations

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **TodoApp**: Main application controller and state management
- **TodoList**: Renders and manages the list of todo items
- **TodoItem**: Individual todo item with edit/delete/complete functionality
- **TodoInput**: Input field and form handling for new todos
- **Storage**: localStorage abstraction layer for data persistence

### Data Model
```javascript
Todo = {
  id: string,        // Unique identifier (timestamp-based)
  text: string,      // Todo item text content
  completed: boolean, // Completion status
  created: string    // ISO timestamp
}
```

### User Interface Patterns
- **Single Page Layout**: Header, input field, todo list, footer
- **Inline Editing**: Click-to-edit functionality for todo text
- **Visual Feedback**: Smooth transitions for state changes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Enter to add, Escape to cancel edits
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large tap targets for mobile devices

### State Management
- **Local State**: In-memory array of todo objects
- **Persistence Layer**: Automatic save to localStorage on each change
- **Event-Driven Updates**: DOM updates triggered by state changes

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Core Structure** (Day 1): HTML skeleton, basic CSS, JavaScript setup
2. **CRUD Operations** (Day 1-2): Add, edit, delete, toggle completion  
3. **Polish & Performance** (Day 2-3): Animations, responsive design, optimization

### Risk Mitigation
- **localStorage Limits**: Implement basic error handling for storage quota
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test on target browsers early
- **Performance**: Monitor bundle size and runtime performance

### Testing Approach
- **Manual Testing**: Cross-browser and device testing
- **Performance Testing**: Lighthouse audits for load time goals
- **Usability Testing**: Verify <3s task creation, <2s task completion

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Project Setup**: Create file structure, basic HTML/CSS/JS files
- [ ] **Data Layer**: Implement todo data model and localStorage persistence  
- [ ] **Core CRUD**: Add, display, edit, delete, and toggle todo functionality
- [ ] **User Interface**: Responsive design, animations, and visual polish
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Code optimization and performance testing

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- None (fully self-contained)

**Browser Requirements:**
- localStorage support (IE8+, all modern browsers)
- ES6+ JavaScript features (modern browsers only)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support

**Development Dependencies:**
- Web browser for testing
- Text editor/IDE
- Optional: Local development server (Python http.server, Node live-server)

## Success Criteria (Technical)

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Page load time: <500ms (Lighthouse measurement)
- Task operations: <100ms response time
- Bundle size: <50KB total (HTML+CSS+JS)
- Lighthouse score: >90 overall

**Quality Gates:**
- All CRUD operations functional
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop  
- No JavaScript errors in browser console
- localStorage persistence working correctly
- Cross-browser compatibility verified

**Code Quality:**
- No functions >20 lines
- Clear naming conventions throughout
- Modular JavaScript structure
- Clean, semantic HTML
- Organized CSS with consistent methodology

## Estimated Effort

**Overall Timeline:** 2-3 development days

**Resource Requirements:**
- 1 developer (full-stack web development skills)
- ~16-24 total development hours

**Critical Path Items:**
1. localStorage data persistence (Day 1)
2. CRUD operations implementation (Day 1-2)  
3. Responsive UI design (Day 2-3)
4. Cross-browser testing (Day 3)

**Effort Breakdown:**
- Setup & Core Structure: 4-6 hours
- CRUD Operations: 6-8 hours
- UI/UX Polish: 4-6 hours  
- Testing & Optimization: 2-4 hours
