- [ ] Automated assessment engine that analyzes research content
- [ ] Publication readiness evaluation with actionable recommendations
- [ ] Quality report generation with detailed feedback
- [ ] Integration with research content management system
- [ ] Validation against academic standards and best practices

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Modular assessment framework with pluggable evaluators
- Key considerations: Academic domain expertise, subjective vs objective criteria, scalability
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/src/quality/` - New module for quality assessment
  - `/src/quality/evaluators/` - Individual quality evaluators
  - `/src/quality/reports/` - Report generation system
  - `/src/types/quality.ts` - Quality assessment type definitions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Research Content Management (Task 002) - content structure and metadata
- [ ] Analytics & Metrics (Task 003) - baseline metrics and tracking

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
