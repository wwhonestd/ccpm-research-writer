# Task: Research Analysis Module

## Description
Implement comprehensive research analysis tools including literature management, intelligent note-taking systems, automated citation tools, and research gap analysis capabilities. This module enables users to efficiently collect, organize, and synthesize research materials for academic and professional writing projects.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Literature management system with import/export capabilities
- [ ] Intelligent note-taking with tagging and categorization
- [ ] Automated citation generation (APA, MLA, Chicago, IEEE formats)
- [ ] Research gap analysis with visualization
- [ ] Cross-reference and connection mapping between sources
- [ ] Search and filter functionality across all research materials
- [ ] Integration with external research databases and APIs

## Technical Details  
- Build on foundation modules (002, 003) for core infrastructure
- Implement modular research analysis components
- Create citation engine with multiple academic formats
- Design database schema for research materials and relationships
- Integrate with external APIs (CrossRef, PubMed, Google Scholar)
- Implement text analysis for research gap identification

## Dependencies
