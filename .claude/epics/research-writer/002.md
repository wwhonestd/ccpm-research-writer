# Task: Data Models & LocalStorage Service

## Description
Design and implement the core data models for the research-writer application and create a robust localStorage service for client-side data persistence. This includes JSON schemas for projects, citations, notes, and drafts with proper validation and error handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define JSON schema for Research Projects
- [ ] Define JSON schema for Citations (APA, MLA, Chicago formats)
- [ ] Define JSON schema for Notes with tagging and categorization
- [ ] Define JSON schema for Drafts with version tracking
- [ ] Implement localStorage service with CRUD operations
- [ ] Add data validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement data export/import functionality

## Technical Details  
- Implementation approach: Pure JavaScript ES6+ with JSON schema validation
- Key considerations: Data integrity, backward compatibility, storage limits, error recovery
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/research-writer/js/models/Project.js` (project data model)
  - `/research-writer/js/models/Citation.js` (citation data model)
  - `/research-writer/js/models/Note.js` (note data model)
  - `/research-writer/js/models/Draft.js` (draft data model)
  - `/research-writer/js/services/StorageService.js` (localStorage wrapper)
  - `/research-writer/js/utils/DataValidator.js` (validation utilities)

## Dependencies
- [ ] No dependencies - foundation task

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All data models implemented with proper schemas
- [ ] LocalStorage service with full CRUD operations
- [ ] Data validation and error handling implemented
- [ ] Export/import functionality working
- [ ] Unit tests for all models and services
- [ ] Storage migration strategy documented
