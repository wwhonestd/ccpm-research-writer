# Task: Project CRUD Operations

## Description
Implement comprehensive Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for research projects, including project management UI components, form validation, and user interaction workflows. This builds on the data models and storage service to provide full project lifecycle management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement project creation form with validation
- [ ] Create project listing and search functionality
- [ ] Build project editing interface with auto-save
- [ ] Add project deletion with confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Implement project duplication/cloning feature
- [ ] Add project metadata management (tags, categories, dates)
- [ ] Create project archive/restore functionality

## Technical Details  
- Implementation approach: Event-driven architecture with form validation and state management
- Key considerations: User experience, data consistency, undo/redo capability, performance
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/research-writer/js/components/ProjectForm.js` (project creation/editing forms)
  - `/research-writer/js/components/ProjectList.js` (project listing and management)
  - `/research-writer/js/controllers/ProjectController.js` (business logic)
  - `/research-writer/css/components/projects.css` (project-specific styles)
  - `/research-writer/views/projects.html` (project management views)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Data Models & LocalStorage Service must be completed
- [ ] Project data model and validation
- [ ] StorageService implementation

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All CRUD operations implemented and tested
- [ ] Form validation and error handling working
- [ ] Project search and filtering functional
- [ ] Auto-save functionality implemented
- [ ] User interface responsive and accessible
- [ ] Integration tests with storage service passing
