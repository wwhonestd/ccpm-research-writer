# Task: Claude API Integration

## Description
Implement comprehensive Claude API integration with intelligent error handling, rate limiting, and context-aware prompting. The system should provide reliable AI-powered assistance for research writing while maintaining robust fallback mechanisms for offline or degraded service scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Claude API wrapper with authentication and secure key management
- [ ] Intelligent rate limiting and request queuing system
- [ ] Context-aware prompt engineering for research-specific tasks
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- [ ] Offline fallback mechanisms and cached responses
- [ ] Request/response logging and monitoring
- [ ] Integration with all major system components

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Service layer with dependency injection, retry policies, circuit breaker pattern
- Key considerations: API reliability, cost optimization, context management, security
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/src/services/claude/` - New Claude API service module
  - `/src/services/claude/client.ts` - API client wrapper
  - `/src/services/claude/prompts/` - Research-specific prompt templates
  - `/src/services/claude/cache.ts` - Response caching system
  - `/src/config/claude.ts` - Claude service configuration
  - Integration points across UI, workflow, quality, and analytics modules

## Dependencies
- [ ] Interactive Research UI (Task 004) - user interface integration
- [ ] Automated Workflows (Task 005) - workflow automation triggers
- [ ] Advanced Search (Task 006) - search enhancement integration
- [ ] Quality Assessment (Task 007) - AI-powered quality evaluation

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 32-40 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Claude API client implemented with full authentication
- [ ] Rate limiting and queuing system prevents API abuse
- [ ] Context-aware prompts generate relevant research assistance
- [ ] Error handling provides meaningful feedback and fallbacks
- [ ] Offline mode maintains core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests cover all API interaction scenarios
- [ ] Monitoring and logging capture API usage and performance
- [ ] Security review completed for API key management
