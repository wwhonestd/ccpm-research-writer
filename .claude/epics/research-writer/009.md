# Task: Export System & Polish

## Description
Implement a comprehensive export system supporting multiple academic formats (PDF, Word, LaTeX) with proper formatting, and perform final UI/UX polish with performance optimization. This task transforms the research writer into a publication-ready tool with professional export capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-format export system (PDF, Word, LaTeX) with academic formatting
- [ ] Template system for different publication styles (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.)
- [ ] Automated citation formatting and bibliography generation
- [ ] Professional UI polish with consistent design system
- [ ] Performance optimization for large documents and complex workflows
- [ ] Export preview and customization options
- [ ] Batch export capabilities for multiple documents

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Pluggable export engine with format-specific renderers, UI component optimization, performance profiling
- Key considerations: Format compatibility, citation accuracy, rendering performance, user experience consistency
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/src/export/` - New export system module
  - `/src/export/formats/` - Format-specific exporters (PDF, Word, LaTeX)
  - `/src/export/templates/` - Academic style templates
  - `/src/export/citations/` - Citation formatting system
  - `/src/ui/` - UI component polish and optimization
  - `/src/performance/` - Performance monitoring and optimization

## Dependencies
- [ ] Interactive Research UI (Task 004) - UI foundation for polish
- [ ] Automated Workflows (Task 005) - export integration in workflows
- [ ] Advanced Search (Task 006) - search results export
- [ ] Quality Assessment (Task 007) - quality metrics in exports

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 36-48 hours
- Parallel: true (with 008)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Export system supports PDF, Word, and LaTeX formats
- [ ] Academic formatting templates implemented and tested
- [ ] Citation system generates accurate bibliographies
- [ ] UI polish completed with consistent design language
- [ ] Performance optimization reduces load times by >30%
- [ ] Export preview allows customization before generation
- [ ] Integration tests cover all export formats and edge cases
- [ ] User acceptance testing validates professional quality output
