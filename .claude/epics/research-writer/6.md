# Task: Structure Design Module

## Description
Create intelligent document structure design tools including outline builder, template selector, word allocation system, and section planning capabilities. This module helps writers organize their ideas and plan document structure before beginning the writing process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Interactive outline builder with drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] Template library for different document types (academic papers, reports, proposals)
- [ ] Intelligent word allocation system across sections
- [ ] Section planning tools with time estimates
- [ ] Hierarchical structure visualization
- [ ] Template customization and saving capabilities
- [ ] Export outline to various formats (markdown, docx, pdf)

## Technical Details  
- Build interactive outline editor with modern UI components
- Create template system with customizable document structures
- Implement word count allocation and tracking algorithms
- Design section planning with time estimation features
- Create visualization components for document structure
- Integrate with foundation modules for data persistence
- Support import/export of outline formats

## Dependencies
