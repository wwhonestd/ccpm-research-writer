**Branch:** epic/todo-list  
**Commit:** 551064d  

## Summary

Successfully implemented all core CRUD operations and user interface interactions for the todo list application. Built upon the excellent foundation provided by Agent-1 (HTML structure) and Agent-2 (data layer), completing the full user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria Status

All acceptance criteria have been completed:

✅ **Add new todo functionality** - Input field + button/Enter key  
✅ **Display all todos in a list format** - With completion status and timestamps  
✅ **Toggle todo completion status** - Checkbox with visual feedback  
✅ **Edit todo text inline** - Click-to-edit with Enter/Escape support  
✅ **Delete individual todos** - Delete button with confirmation dialog  
✅ **Show todo creation timestamps** - Human-readable relative time  
✅ **Handle empty todo text validation** - Input validation and user feedback  
✅ **Provide visual feedback for user actions** - Hover states and transitions  
✅ **Ensure all operations update localStorage automatically** - Integrated with Agent-2's data layer  

## Features Implemented

### 1. Inline Edit Functionality
- **Click-to-edit**: Users can click on todo text to edit inline
- **Edit button**: Dedicated edit button (✏️) for explicit editing
- **Keyboard controls**: Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- **Auto-save on blur**: Changes are saved when clicking elsewhere
- **Input validation**: Prevents empty text and respects length limits
- **Visual feedback**: Blue background during editing mode

### 2. Timestamp Display
- **Relative time format**: "just now", "5m ago", "2h ago", "3d ago", etc.
- **Tooltip with full date**: Hover shows complete creation timestamp
- **Smart formatting**: Automatically switches to date format for old items
- **Real-time updates**: Timestamps reflect current time differences

### 3. Delete Confirmation
- **Confirmation dialog**: Prevents accidental deletions
- **Clear messaging**: Shows which todo will be deleted
- **Safe operation**: Only deletes after user confirmation

### 4. Enhanced Visual Feedback
- **Hover states**: Interactive elements highlight on hover
